Framework : 
	1. TestNG
	2. JUnit
	3. Keyword Driven 
	4. Data Driven
	5. Behaviour Driver
	6. Hybrid {combination two or more}
	
BDD (Behaviour Driver Development)
	
	BDD --> Scenarios {Behaviour is defined} --converted to--> test cases
	
	BDD Framework important parts are --> 1. Feature file 2. Step Definition 3. Test Runner
	
	1. Feature File : 
			Scenarios, Scenarios Outline & Background are written usign gherkin keyword
			
	2. Step Definition : 
			Run the feature as Cucumber option --> it will generates snippets in console
			Use these snippets to implement the test cases in step definition classes
	
	3. Runner File :
			we specify the cucumber option
				a. feature --> either specific feature file or folder where feature files are present
				b. glue --> we specify the step definition classes package name and hooks class package name
				c. tags --> in order to execute the specific scenario from the feature file we can use tags and specify those tags here
				d. plugin --> report generations
				e. monochrome --> to make console more readable
	
	It was a maven project, so with the help of pom.xml where all the dependencies were added related to the tools used.
	Basically we have used page object model to design the framework
	Under page object model we have created separate class for each web page, and there we have implemented encapsulation concepts
	For reporting we have used extent reports
	we are running this maven project through batch file.
			

Difference between BDD hooks and background

	Background is written in the feature file
	If you have certain pre-conditions which you want business unit to know then include that into background
	Background will be executed before every scenario of that feature file
	
	BDD Hooks
	If you certain pre-conditions which are more technical and if you don't want to show it to business unit
	then those pre-conditions we can include in hooks
	Business unit will not look into hooks
	Hooks are to two type
		1. Before : executed before every scenario
		2. After : executed after every scenario
	we can have multiple hooks, and also we can define their priority of execution.
	
Order of execution --> first hooks are executed then background will be executed then scenario
